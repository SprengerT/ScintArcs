# ScintArcs
A collection of interactive codes to manually measure scintillation arc parameters.

Example scripts for each method are included. They can be adapted to save intermediate computations of required data transformations or to loop over a series of data.

Executing the same codes in jupyter notebook may not work because of the altered order of executing lines of code and interactive plots.
